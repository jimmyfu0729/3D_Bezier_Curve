# 3D_Bezier_Curve

This program is to plot the bezier curve in 3D. The main.m file has the example to show how to use the function. In the function, please notice that the control points matrix is transposed so if you want to input the control points please add "`" to transpose the matrix back.

The untitle.png shows the output of the main.m.

Thank you!
